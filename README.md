# VBA-Challenge

In this challenge, I have to use Microsoft Excel and VBA to sort data from two stock data spreadsheets. Using VBA, I was able to fill in hundreds of cells by code into several new columns formed, in addition to changing colors to correspond to various value intervals that were positive or negative.
